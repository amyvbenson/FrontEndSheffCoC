## Code of Conduct

All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our event are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

### Need Help?

Contact us at frontendsheff@gmail.com, on twitter @FrontEndSheff or talk to one of the event organisers (we'll introduce ourselves at the start of the event).

### The Quick Version

Our event is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of event attendees in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media associated with the event. Attendees violating these rules may be expelled from the event at the discretion of the organisers.

### The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of event staff immediately.

Event staff will be happy to assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at event venues and event-related social events.
